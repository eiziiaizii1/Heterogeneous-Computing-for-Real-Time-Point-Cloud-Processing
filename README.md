# Heterogeneous-Computing-for-Real-Time-Point-Cloud-Processing
Parallel Programming-1 project
Description: This project investigates heterogeneous computing systems combining CPUs, GPUs to optimize real-time processing of LiDAR point-cloud data. It aims to propose and implement efficient methods for dynamic workload distribution, ensuring maximum performance and responsiveness. The project will specifically focus on computationally intensive operations like data pre-processing, feature extraction, clustering, segmentation, and simple object detection to highlight the advantages of using heterogeneous systems.

Motivation: Efficient real-time processing of LiDAR data is increasingly critical for autonomous vehicles, robotic navigation systems, smart-city infrastructures, and disaster response operations. Real-time processing demands high computational power and low latency, making heterogeneous computing systems essential to handle massive datasets promptly.

Key Objectives:

Identify and implement suitable algorithms for LiDAR point-cloud processing that are optimized for heterogeneous computing environments.

Develop effective workload distribution and scheduling strategies to efficiently balance computational loads across CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators.

Integrate software frameworks or middleware (e.g., OpenCL, CUDA) to facilitate seamless collaboration among diverse computing resources.

Perform extensive benchmarking to evaluate system performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability, and resource utilization.

Use profiling and monitoring tools to analyze performance bottlenecks, optimize algorithms, and improve overall efficiency.

Demonstrate practical applicability by testing the system using publicly available LiDAR datasets (e.g., KITTI, NuScenes).
